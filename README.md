TeraSort benchmark for Spark

This is an example Spark program for running TeraSort benchmarks. It is based on
work from [Reynold Xin's branch](https://github.com/rxin/spark/tree/terasort),
but it is not the same TeraSort program that currently holds the
[record](http://sortbenchmark.org/). That program is
[here](https://github.com/rxin/spark/tree/sort-benchmark/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sort).
